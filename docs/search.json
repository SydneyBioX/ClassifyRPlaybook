    "text": "1.1 Precision medicine and the need for advanced classification tools\nPrecision medicine is a personalised approach to healthcare that tailors prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to an individual’s unique characteristics such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and molecular data. By integrating diverse data types, the ultimate goal of precision medicine is to deliver the right decision or treatment to the right patient at the right time. While this has driven the development of complex classification strategies, realising this vision relies on robust evaluation of model performance at both cohort and patient levels. \n\n1.1.1 What is ClassifyR?\nThis playbook presents ClassifyR, a comprehensive machine learning framework tailored for multi-omics classification problems in a precision medicine context. ClassifyR was first introduced in 2015 as a tool for assessing classification performance in omics research, particularly evaluating feature selection approaches in transcriptomics (Strbenac et al., 2015). It provides systematic comparison of predictive models, emphasising accuracy, stability and interpretability. While machine learning evaluation frameworks such as caret and mlr in R and scikit-learn in Python provide general-purpose machine learning frameworks, they lack specific capabilities for pre-processing, feature selection, feature interrogation, multi-omic integration and cross-platform performance evaluation. Standardising these procedures into a unified framework can facilitate more systematic and robust evaluations. Thus, ClassifyR distinguishes itself in multiple ways:\n\nBioconductor ecosystem integration: ClassifyR is interoperable with established omics data structures in the Bioconductor Project, ensuring seamless access to single-cell, multi-omics, and spatial technologies.\nFull cross-validation workflow: The package performs comprehensive cross-validation by including feature selection and hyperparameter tuning within the cross-validation procedure, which is essential for handling large-scale omics datasets.\nCross-dataset and cross-modality validation: Models can be both constructed and evaluated across cohorts and omics platforms, addressing issues of reproducibility and transferability.\nPrecision medicine focus: ClassifyR includes frameworks for assessing model appropriateness at an individual patient level which is crucial for evaluating which model or modality is appropriate for which patient.\n\nBy addressing these critical gaps, ClassifyR enables researchers to explore complex disease mechanisms, optimise diagnostic workflows, and guide treatment strategies in precision medicine.",

Sample accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted classifications over multiple repeats. For example, if 70 out of 100 repeats correctly classify an individual, their sample accuracy is 0.70.\nThis analysis involves 54 oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) breast cancer patients, with each assay containing expression values for 268 genes. The classification outcomes are ‘Subtype 1’ and ‘Subtype 2’, found by unsupervised machine learning. Subtype 1 corresponds to patients with higher expression of LPL, CAVIN2, and TIMP4 in macrophage cells, and ADIPOQ in stromal cells, associated with better survival. Subtype 2 is the opposite, associated with poorer survival. More details on the subtypes can be found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.02.601790v1.full.",

The first is an mRNA dataset assayed using Sentrix Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The second is a microRNA dataset with expression profiling performed using Agilent Technologies’ microRNA platform (version 16, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The prognosis outcome is classified as “Good” if survival is greater than 4 years from the date of tumor banking and “Poor” if survival is less than 1 year from the date of tumor banking.

The second command trains a multi-platform precision pathway using the two assays given the prognostic outcomes in the “Outcome” column in colData(mel_mae) Finally, the costs and performance of each potential pathway is calculated. Here, the cost of using clinical, mRNA and miRNA data have respectively been approximated to $0, $12400 and $8000.\n4.

There are two possible pathways proposed: using clinical then mRNA data or using clinical then miRNA data. Both pathways achieve the same balanced accuracy of 0.75 but due to the lower cost of miRNA sequencing, the second pathway attains a higher score and is the preferable option for prognostic purposes.\n\nbubblePlot(pp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bubble plot visualises the summary created above. In a situation with more potential pathways, it would allow greater ease in selecting the best pathway to optimise cost and performance. Here, clinical-miRNA would be the preferred pathway due to its lower cost while achieving the same balanced accuracy.\n\nflowchart(pp, \"clinical-miRNA_pair\")\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that clinical-miRNA is the selected pathway, this function creates a flowchart to show the stepwise process for determining melanoma prognosis. Clinical data is first used to classify patients into three prognosis groups: • Good prognosis: 44% of patients (27 out of total 62). • Uncertain prognosis: 21% of patients (13 out of 62) • Poor prognosis: 35% of patients (22 out of 62). Thus, clinical data alone classifies 71% of patients (Good + Poor groups), while 21% requiring further assessment.\nFor the Uncertain prognosis group (13 patients), additional analysis using miRNA pair data refines the classification: • Good prognosis: 19% (12 patients) are identified as “Good.” • Uncertain prognosis: 0% (0 patients) remain “Uncertain.” • Poor prognosis: 2% (1 patient) is reclassified as “Poor.” This is why a potential pathway incorporating clinical, mRNA, and miRNA data was not considered, as the first two datasets alone provided a prognosis outcome for all individuals.\n\nstrataPlot(pp, \"clinical-miRNA_pair\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function creates a plot which allow us to visualise where the prognosis went wrong. A large amount of blue in the clinical row under the green, suggests that this pathway made the most errors in prognosis when first using clinical data, as it classified many “good” prognosis patients with “poor” prognosis. However, clinical data performed comparatively much better on “poor” prognosis patients due to the lesser proportion of blue. For the individuals who continued to use miRNA, there was high sensitivity in identifying individuals with a good prognosis but its specificity was limited as some individuals with a poor prognosis were misclassified as having a good prognosis.",
